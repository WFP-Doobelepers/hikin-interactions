      Grants her a thicker shield with 20% extra shield strength. Also provides
      shields at 35% absorption of her own to nearby party members for 12s. This
      is especially useful in co-op and the uptime is very good. Rating: 3/5

      Generate 1 energy per *Shooting Star* hit. Within one duration of her
      shield 12 hits can be expected therefore dramatically reducing her burst
      ER requirement. This enables her to Burst off cooldown easily in Cryo
      teams and makes it viable in non-Cryo teams. Rating: 4 - 4.5/5

      Adds 3 more levels to her Skill. This boosts her shield absorption for
      another 20%. With her skill not being her main source of damage the gain
      here is negligible. Rating: 2.5/5

      When firing *Shooting Stars*, increase Normal and Charged Attack DMG based
      on Layla's Max HP. A decent bonus, becomes better with amplifying 
      reactions. Rating: 2.5/5

      Adds 3 more levels to her Burst. Some extra damage however the gain is
      negligible given she will not be a major contributor to team damage.

      *Shooting Stars* and *Starlight Slugs* deal 40% increased damage. And
      Night Stars are automatically generated every 1.2s instead of 1.5s. It is
      hard to pull off another wave of Shooting Stars without sacrificing
      driver/carry’s on- field time. Rating: 3/5
