  description: |-
    🏛️ Try to get in **three Skill casts** to manage Kaveh’s Energy. To do this, cast one Skill around the start of your rotation. Cast the other two during Kaveh’s Burst.
    
    🏛️ **N3 Dash** is his best Normal Attack combo as it has the highest MVs and Dendro application.
    
    🏛️ **Avoid** casting Burst > Skill or Skill > Burst in quick succession. If you Burst and rupture your Dendro Cores, you won’t have anything to detonate if you use your Skill right away!
    
    🏛️ Make sure there are Dendro Cores in the radius to make sure your Burst/Skill actually detonates them.
    
    🏛️ Avoid spending too much time on Kaveh – your Hydro/Electro/Pyro application and buffs will expire eventually.
