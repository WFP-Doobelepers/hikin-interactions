    __Artifact Sets__

    **4pc Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City**
  description: Xilonen’s undisputed BiS Artifact set. The 2pc lowers her ER requirements 
    and the 4pc grants all party members a 40% Geo DMG bonus and an additional Elemental 
    DMG Bonus depending on  the Element with which Crystallize is generated.

- title: "**4pc Archaic Petra**"
  description: Practically wasted 2pc effect because of Xilonen’s low multipliers. 
    The 4pc effect provides a 35% dmg bonus, but it requires that a Crystallize shard 
    be picked up, making it harder to utilize compared to Scroll while providing a lower buff, 
    on top of not buffing Geo.

- title: "**4pc Instructor**"
  description: Being a 4 Star Artifact Set, Xilonen holding Instructor will likely result in 
    her overall stats being lower compared to other 5 star artifact sets, which in turn will 
    lead to lower healing and buffing if she is holding her Signature Weapon. The buff provided 
    is also worth less compared to Scroll and is only useful if her team members rely on Elemental Mastery.

- title: "**4pc Obsidian Codex**"
  description: Xilonen’s best set for her personal damage because of the amount of buffs 
    it provides for Natlanian characters. However, using Xilonen as a damage dealer at low 
    Constellations is not recommended, with her supportive builds very much preferred.
