      *Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are theoretical suggestions.
      Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs, additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC, the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.*

- title: __OVERVIEW__
  description: "Xilonen is a 5-star Geo Sword character from Natlan whose kit revolves around 
    activating her samples, which are based on her teammates’ elements. These samples provide 
    Geo, Pyro, Electro, Cryo or Hydro RES Shred. Xilonen’s Elemental Skill makes her enter the 
    Nightsoul's Blessing state, during which, if there are at least 2 Pyro, Electro, Cryo or 
    Hydro characters in the team,  she can use her Normal Attacks  to activate her samples and 
    thus her RES Shred. In that team, Xilonen’s Elemental Burst heals the active character for 
    an amount based on her DEF. \n\nXilonen is mainly a support for characters of the aforementioned 
    element. That being said, when using her in a team where there is only one or less Pyro, Electro, 
    Cryo or Hydro characters, she can be used as a damage dealer, using her Geo-infused Normal Attacks 
    or Plunges and Elemental Burst to deal damage.
