    **Peak Patrol Song**
  description: Xilonen’s Best-in-Slot weapon increases both her personal and the 
    entire team’s damage through its strong passive. While it is a guaranteed damage 
    increase for the entire team over Favonius Sword, due to the nature of teams often 
    appreciating the added help with their ER needs, the mileage you get out of this 
    weapon will vary based on the ER needs of her teams, meaning that its effect will 
    be most noticeable in teams that aren’t energy hungry.

- title: "**Favonius Sword**"
  description: "Her second best option overall, and definitely her best 4* Weapon, Favonius 
    Sword is so beneficial to her teams overall that it is worth using over any weapon that 
    focuses on increasing Xilonen’s pitifully low personal damage. It is recommended that 
    players build enough CRIT Rate to consistently trigger its passive. Naturally, Favonius 
     perform best on higher refinements, but for players that don’t have her Signature Weapon, 
     there is no reason not to use Favonius Sword even on lower refinements."

- title: "**Key of Khaj-Nisut**"
  description: Key requires 3 Skill uses to activate its teamwide EM buff. With how her rotations 
    line up, the Weapon can only have the buff active in the second rotation at the earliest, with 
    some teams potentially taking three rotations for the Weapon passive to activate. In either case, 
    the mediocre buff the weapon provides along with it encouraging Xilonen to build high HP, a stat 
    she doesn’t normally favor, makes it hard to justify using this weapon over her other options, 
    even for teams that favor EM buffs.

- title: "**Freedom-Sworn**"
  description: In most of Xilonen’s teams, it will perform similarly, if not worse, than all options 
    not listed here. While the buff might look good at first glance, Xilonen can have a hard time 
    triggering the passive. Hence, even for teams that benefit fully from the buff it provides, it will 
    not be consistent enough or last long enough to justify using Freedom-Sworn over her other options. 
    In teams that heavily favor ATK buffs, such as Arlecchino or Navia teams, while equipping Freedom-Sworn 
    on Xilonen theoretically results in very high damage for the on-field carries, the lack of team utility 
    and adjusted rotations to accommodate its buff means that it might at times negatively affect uptime of 
    other buffs and Bursts, making it fall behind her other options.

- title: "**Xiphos' Moonlight**"
  description: In most of her teams, Xiphos will be a downgrade compared to her other options despite 
    the ER it provides to the entire team. Xilonen herself doesn’t value the EM this weapon requires 
    building in order to benefit from the passive, and even then ER it provides is significantly lower 
    than what Favonius Sword can offer. This weapon should only be considered if you do not have an 
    available Favonius Sword and your team really needs help with the Energy.

- title: "**Wolf-Fang/Uraku Misugiri/Cinnabar Spindle/Dull Blade**"
  description: "Xilonen’s personal damage is low even when she is built for damage, so all weapons 
    that are focused on her personal damage over team buffs will perform similarly, with less than 
    a 1% difference between them. If the team doesn’t require the help with ER and you don’t own 
    her Signature Weapon, Dull Blade would unironically be a great option for her considering how 
    close it is to other weapons, limited 5*s included, that could benefit other characters way more."
