    In short, Xilonen’s role in teams is almost identical to that of Kazuha, minus the 
    AOE damage and Crowd Control, but with the addition of strong healing and the ability 
    to buff the Geo element. She can also be used as a Zhongli replacement when his Shielding 
    capabilities aren’t needed for the interruption resistance since she provides more RES Shred 
    as well as healing to sustain the team. Xilonen is also able to be used as an on-field DPS even 
    at low Constellations, but that will often result in less damage than if she were to be used to buff another carry.

    ### Arlecchino | Hydro | Bennett | Xilonen
    As mentioned above, this team replaces Kazuha with Xilonen. However, since her healing doesn’t 
    benefit Arlecchino and Kazuha can also easily provide RES Shred and DMG% for both Hydro and Pyro, 
    she is not an upgrade unless dealing with multi-wave content where Kazuha cannot easily refresh his Res Shred.

    ### Neuvilette | Furina | Kazuha | Xilonen
    Neuvillette doesn’t have many decent options for his fourth slot in this team, and Xilonen fits perfectly 
    here, providing almost a second Kazuha’s worth of buffs, with the addition of healing which offers more 
    survivability and which Furina is able to utilize to gain more stacks for her Elemental Burst’s buff.

- title: "**Navia**"

    ### Navia | Furina/Fischl | Bennett | Xilonen
    Navia benefits immensely from Xilonen since her other options for a second Geo slot were either Zhongli, 
    who has lackluster particle generation and thus hinders Navia, or Chiori who while providing an excellent 
    amount of particles, is not fully utilized in this team at Constellation 0 due to Navia’s lack of Geo Constructs. 
    In addition to solving both issues while buffing Navia, Xilonen also provides a large amount of healing, enabling greater synergy with Furina.
