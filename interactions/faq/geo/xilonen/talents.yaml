- title: __Analysis__
  description: "- The most important part of Xilonen's kit, the multi-Element RES Shred, 
    is applied via her Elemental Skill, while the RES Shred scales off the Skill’s talent 
    level, which should be prioritized over all her other talents. Next up are her healing 
    capabilities, which is provided by her Burst. That being said, leveling her Burst is 
    only a necessity if you desire more healing and / or want to improve her synergy with 
    Furina. Leveling her Normal Attack is only a notable benefit if you are looking to 
    build her to be an on-field DPS."

    __TALENT OVERVIEW__

    **Normal Attack: Ehecatl’s Roar**
  description: "- Outside of her Nightsoul’s Blessing state, Xilonen's Normal Attacks 
    are lackluster. Additionally, while her Normal and Plunging Attacks are infused 
    with Geo while she is in the Nightsoul’s Blessing state, her damage does not warrant 
    investing in it when she is not used as an on-field DPS. This however, changes when 
    her C6 is unlocked, which greatly improves her personal DMG."

- title: "**Elemental Skill: Yohual’s Scratch**"
  description: "*CD: **7s***\n\n- Xilonen’s Elemental Skill is the highlight of her character kit, 
    providing multi-Element RES Shred based on her team's Elemental composition. Xilonen's Elemental 
    Skill gives her 3 Samplers which can sample the Element of her teammates. Initially, these samplers 
    start as Geo, and when activated, reduce the Elemental RES of nearby enemies by 33% for the sampled Elements 
    (at Talent Level 9, C0). 

    \n \nAfter her Elemental Skill is used, she will gain 45 Nightsoul Points and enter the Nightsoul's 
    Blessing state, which starts her samplers as Geo. When her team has at least 2 Pyro/Cryo/Electro/Hydro 
    characters, her Ascension 1 Passive Talent allows her to gain 35 Nightsoul points after performing a Normal 
    or Plunging Attack during her Nightsoul's Blessing state, with a maximum of 90 points. When her Nightsoul 
    points reach 90 after two Normal/Plunging Attacks, she will consume all her Nightsoul points and activate 
    her 3 Source Samplers, which decrease the Elemental RES shred of her enemies by 33% for each element from 
    Pyro/Cryo/Electro/Hydro/Geo in her party. It is important to note that two Samplers of the same Element 
    will not stack buffs."

    "*CD: **15s***
    *Energy cost: **60***

    - The functionality of Xilonen's Elemental Burst is based on the state of her Source Samplers. 
    Xilonen deals an initial instance of Nightsoul Aligned Geo DMG that scales off of her DEF. If 
    at least 2 Source Samplers are sampling an Element from Pyro/Cryo/Electro/Hydro, Xilonen will 
    heal the active character over time, the amount of healing increasing with her DEF. However, 
    if less than 2 of the Samplers have their Elements changed from Geo, she will deal an additional 
    instance of Nightsoul-aligned Geo DMG. Overall, this skill is good for ensuring survivability in
     multi-Element team compositions and for some additional Geo DMG in Geo teams."

    __Passives__

    **Ascension 1 Passive: Netotiliztli's Echoes**
  description: |-
    - Her A1 Passive allows her to consistently activate her Source Samplers to sample Elements outside 
    Geo. Similar to her Elemental Burst, Xilonen's A1 Passive has two outcomes based on the state of her 
    samplers. When Xilonen is in her Nightsoul's Blessing state with at least 2 samplers being Pyro/Cryo/Electro/Hydro, 
    her Normal and Plunging Attacks give her 35 Nightsoul Points. If she has less than 2 samplers that have not 
    switched Elements from Geo, she will gain a 30% Normal Attack Bonus.

- title: "**Ascension 4 Passive: Portable Armored Sheath**"
  description: |-
    - Her Ascension 4 Passive Talent allows her to trigger an additional Nightsoul Burst, 
    which increases her DEF by 20% and can also trigger any Nightsoul Burst-related effects, 
    such as the 2pc effect of the Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City artifact set.

- title: "**Night Realm's Gift: Blessing of Forge-Fire**"
  description: |-
    - This talent allows Xilonen to consume Phlogiston to extend her Nightsoul’s Blessing 
    state for longer while exploring Natlan. Similar to Kachina, this talent also allows 
    an active character that is sprinting/climbing to switch to Xilonen, which grants her 
    20 Nightsoul points and activates her Nightsoul’s Blessing state.
