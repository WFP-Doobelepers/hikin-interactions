- title: __ENERGY RECHARGE REQUIREMENTS__
  description: "Xilonen’s ER requirements in order to Burst every rotation depend 
    largely on her team, with teams which have additional Geo characters needing 
    very little ER, while the opposite means her ER needs can shoot up to 230% ER, 
    and that’s only if she catches her own particles. \n\nHer Burst does not contribute 
    much damage and can be safely disregarded unless needed for every rotation for 
    survivability and/or to provide healing for Furina’s drain to work. \n\nIt is 
    worth noting that using her Burst every other rotation instead reduces her ER 
    requirements by roughly half. \n\nXilonen’s
    ER requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more accurate
    estimate, please use the Energy Recharge Calculator linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vkmgp5n0bI9pvhUg110Aza3Emb2puLWdeoCgrxDlu4/copy).\nFor
