      > *When using Salon Solitaire, Furina gains "Center of Attention" for 10s.

      > Throughout the duration, Furina's Normal Attacks, Charged Attacks, and
      Plunging Attacks are converted into Hydro DMG which cannot be overridden
      by any other elemental infusion. DMG is also increased by an amount
      equivalent to 18% of Furina's max HP.

      > Throughout the duration, Furina's Normal Attacks (not including Arkhe:
      Seats Sacred and Secular Attacks), Charged Attacks, and the impact of
      Plunging Attacks will cause different effects up to every 0.1s after
      hitting opponents depending on her current Arkhe alignment:

      > 

      > Arkhe: Ousia

      > Every 1s, all nearby characters in the party will be healed by 4% of
      Furina's max HP, for a duration of 2.9s. Triggering this effect again will
      extend its duration.

      > Arkhe: Pneuma

      > This Normal Attack (not including Arkhe: Seats Sacred and Secular
      Attacks), Charged Attack, or Plunging Attack ground impact DMG will be
      further increased by an amount equivalent to 25% of Furina's max HP. When
      any of the attacks mentioned previously hit an opponent, all nearby
      characters in the party will consume 1% of their current HP.

      > 

      > During the duration of each instance of "Center of Attention," the above
      effects can be triggered up to 6 times. "Center of Attention" will end
      when its effects have triggered 6 times or when the duration expires.*


      After casting Furina’s Skill, she gains a Hydro infusion, dealing an extra
      18% of her Max HP, as well as special effects on her next 6 Normal Attacks
      based on her Arkhe alignment. This Constellation is similar in function to
      Nahida and Yelan’s C6, taking a small amount of field time in exchange for
      some extra personal damage. When Furina is aligned with Ousia, her Normal
      Attacks will heal the party over time. However, when she’s aligned with
      Pneuma, her Normal Attacks will gain an additional scaling of 25% of her
      Max HP and will also drain 1% of all party member’s current HP. 


      These offensive and defensive forms are inverted from her Elemental Skill,
      which deals damage when aligned with Ousia, but heals when aligned with
      Pneuma. Because of this, Furina is unable to generate Particles whilst in
      her Pneuma stance and sacrifices her Salon Member’s damage for extra HP
      scalings on her Normal Attacks. She can still swap her alignment freely
      during this state though, allowing players to mix and match the effects
      from both Arkhe alignments. After 6 hits or 10 seconds, this effect will
      be cleared.


      Due to the high damage output provided by her Pneuma stance, 4pc
      Marechaussee Hunter becomes competitive and can beat out 4pc Golden
      Troupe, allowing players to frontload more damage due to the large amounts
      of CRIT Rate. Furina’s extremely high damage output at C6 allows players
      to dispense of enemies very quickly, even without her Salon Members being
      active.
