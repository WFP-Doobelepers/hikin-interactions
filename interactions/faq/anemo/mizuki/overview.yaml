- title: __OVERVIEW__
  description: "Mizuki is a 5-star Anemo Catalyst wielder whose method for dealing
    damage is buffing and creating Swirl reactions while on-field. In addition to
    this, she can heal the active party and heal herself twice as effectively. \n\nMost
    of her damage is dealt during her Skill state that she enters on input, allowing
    her to float around and periodically hit enemies while swirling elements and healing.
    Since many of her abilities scale with Elemental mastery, it will be essential
    to not only equip her with the 4pc Viridescent Venerer artifact set, but also
    getting EM mainstats and substats.\n\nThis leaves Mizuki with limited, but budget-friendly
    weapon and artifact options; VV has been around since the beginning of the game,
    and since EM is the only stat that matters to Mizuki, throwing nearly any Elemental
    Mastery catalyst on Mizuki will get the job done in terms of personal damage.
    However, one of her biggest drawbacks is her team restrictions, synergizing only
    with Pyro, Hydro, Electro, or Cryo characters that automatically attack from off
    field on their own. This leaves options for teammates pretty limited.\n\nAlternatively,
    Mizuki can be played as an off-field DPS with a buffing weapon like Hakushin Ring
    so another character can play the role of the on-field DPS, but Mizuki’s abilities
    are pretty constrained like this; her only job would be to Swirl and then leave
    the battlefield. Considering the Skill only grants particles while she is on the
    field, this is unwise unless you have lots of ER and energy-supportive teammates.\n\nHer
    Burst is mostly used for healing, but is also used for incremental damage when
    the healing isn’t used. It’s advised to make sure she can Burst, but you’ll likely
    want a teammate like Fischl to ensure Burst ability without hampering Mizuki’s
    potential Elemental Mastery.\n"
