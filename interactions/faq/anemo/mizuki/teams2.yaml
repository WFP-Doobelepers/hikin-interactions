    ### Mizuki | Mavuika | Furina | Ororon
    Ororon applies Electro and buffs elements with 4pc Cinder City, Furina buffs the whole team while dealing respectable Hydro damage off-field, and Mavuika stays off-field to use her Skill, then when her Burst is available, she can drop her powerful Burst and swap off again. Mostly a “good stuff” team that doesn’t have any particularly unique or valuable synergies.

    ### Mizuki | Bennett | Xiangling | Citlali
    Of course, a huge amount of characters are compatible with the Bennett and Xiangling duo, and Mizuki can do the same job any other Anemo unit in this team can do; just on-field. Citlali is here mainly to buff Xiangling.
