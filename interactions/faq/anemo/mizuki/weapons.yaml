    **Hakushin Ring (R5)**
  description: If you team up with an Electro character, which is highly likely due
    to scarce teammate compatibility outside of Fischl, Yae Miko, and some Archons,
    this is the best option for team DPS. Since the weapon buff applies to multiple
    elements at once and needs to be triggered on-field, not only does this feel made
    for Mizuki, but it also packs quite a punch for a craftable weapon, allowing Mizuki
    to buff nearly the entire team.

  description: More particles are always welcome, and this weapon will also help solve
    any energy requirements Mizuki might have. Since she’s spending 10s+ on-field,
    she has many opportunities to CRIT, even with a low CRIT Rate stat.

  description: Nahida’s signature weapon that provides a minor amount of EM to the
    party. Only use if Hakushin doesn’t work for your Mizuki teams.

- title: "**Wandering Evenstar**"
  description: Offers a negligible flat ATK buff based on Mizuki’s EM. Like A Thousand
    Floating Dreams, this buff is not enough to outvalue Hakushin Ring

- title: "**Sunny Morning Sleep-In**"
  description: Just a ton of EM. Mizuki’s signature weapon. Good for personal DPS,
    but team dps arguably matters more, and this requiring pulling on the weapon banner
    makes this an unappealing choice.

  description: Even a 3-star will do. If you’re using Mizuki off-field, she can at
    least wield Thrilling Tales to buff the actual on-field DPS, worst-case scenario.
