- title: __ENERGY RECHARGE REQUIREMENTS__
  description: "It’s not reasonable to expect Mizuki to Burst reliably in Xiangling
    teams or Overvape teams, as the recharge needs go beyond 200%. Mizuki struggles
    maintaining a serviceable DPS even on 100% Energy Recharge, so building to Burst
    in these teams is not worth it. \n\nEssentially, Mizuki is married to C6 Fischl
    for energy to be manageable.\n\nYour team’s ER requirements will vary based on
    your team and rotation. For a more accurate estimate, please use the Energy Recharge
    Calculator linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vkmgp5n0bI9pvhUg110Aza3Emb2puLWdeoCgrxDlu4/copy).\nFor
    more details on how Favonius weapons will affect your team, please use Ac1d’s
