    __CONSTELLATIONS__

    **Constellation 1 - In Mist-Like Waters**
  description: |-
    > _When Yumemizuki Mizuki is in the Dreamdrifter state, she will continuously apply the "Twenty-Three Nights' Awaiting" effect to nearby opponents for 3s every 3.5s. When an opponent is affected by Anemo DMG-triggered Swirl reactions while the aforementioned effect is active, the effect will be canceled and this Swirl instance has its DMG against this opponent increased by 900% of Mizuki's Elemental Mastery._

    Mostly an occasional buff to her Swirl hits, but only one at a time. This can only trigger up to four times per Skill use. It’s a huge boost to her personal DPS, but her C2 remains superior for team DPS.

    > _When entering the Dreamdrifter state, every Elemental Mastery point Yumemizuki Mizuki has will increase all nearby party members' Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, and Electro DMG Bonuses by 0.04% until the Dreamdrifter state ends._

    Basically Kazuha’s Fourth Ascension Passive, but only active while Mizuki is in her Skill state and on-field. This is quite a powerful buff and is a solid place to stop if one isn’t aiming for C6.
