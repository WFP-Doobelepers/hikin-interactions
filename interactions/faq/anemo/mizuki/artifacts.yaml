    **4pc Viridescent Venerer**
  description: The ability to shred resistances to Pyro, Electro, Cryo, and Hydro
    damage by 40% is the hallmark trait that nearly every Anemo unit cherishes. There
    are simply no comparable options, since there are so few other sources of RES
    shred besides Xilonen, Zhongli and Chevreuse (which disallows Anemo units in her
    teams anyways).
