    > _While Yumemizuki Mizuki is in the Dreamdrifter state, Swirl DMG dealt by nearby party members can Crit, with CRIT Rate fixed at 30%, and CRIT DMG fixed at 100%._

    Swirls can CRIT now! Having these ratios set in stone means you won’t be incentivized to build CRIT. This will also affect all other party members, in the occasion you’re paired with an off-field Anemo applicator.
