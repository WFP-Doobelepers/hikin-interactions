    ## __Analysis__

    Being so focused on Elemental Mastery, the only thing she needs to maximize her damage is just a ton of EM and being at Max level for the best base damage on reactions. Her Skill buffs her Swirls and her Burst buffs her healing, but these are not nearly as important as just a ton of EM.
