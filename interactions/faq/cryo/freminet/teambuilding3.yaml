      ### **Freminet | Bennett | Xiangling/Anemo | Flex**
      At the time of writing, Freminet as a Reverse Melt carry is lackluster compared to the two other playstyles due to the shared ICD within his Elemental Skill. It is also hard to keep a consistent Pyro Aura on the enemies to Reverse Melt as many hits as possible, therefore it will not be discussed thoroughly in this FAQ.
