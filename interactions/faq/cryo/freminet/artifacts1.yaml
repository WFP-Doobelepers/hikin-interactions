      *Goblet of Eonothem:* Physical/Cryo DMG%\n<:circlet:1094559608581922966> *Circlet
      of Logos:* CRIT%\n\nFreminet can be built for either Physical or Cryo damage,
      which will affect both his playstyle and teams. He prefers an ADC build. Building
      Freminet with full EM artifacts is not recommended since he does not boost Shatter
      damage, nor does Shatter deal significant damage. Freminet simply uses Shatter
      as a means to amplify his Cryo and/or Physical damage.\t\n\nFor Freminet's Physical
      build, 4pc Pale Flame pulls far ahead of its competition. Freminet has good uptime
      on its set effect because of his frequent Skill usages. For Freminet's Cryo build,
      4pc Blizzard Strayer is similarly far better than other options due to its set
      effect's CRIT increase. However, the 2-piece sets listed in this section perform
      decently enough, especially if they have great substats, and can serve as good
      transitional pieces until a full 4-piece set is acquired.\n\nIt is not recommended
      to farm the 4.0 Fontaine artifact domain specifically for Freminet, as he does
      not perform spectacularly on those sets. Only consider using the new artifact
      sets on Freminet if you obtain them while farming for other characters who utilize
      those sets much better. Otherwise, it is much more efficient to farm the Pale
      Flame and Blizzard Strayer domain for him.\n\n**Substats:** ER (until requirement)
