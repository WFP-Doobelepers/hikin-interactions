    __Artifact Sets__

    **4pc Obsidian Codex**
  description: |-
    Every other artifact set is significantly worse than this one’s damage output by more than 10%. 4pc Crimson Witch is the next alternative, but it’s nearly 15% worse. It’s worth the resin to farm Obsidian Codex for Mavuika.

    However, if you use Furina, it’ll be within 5% damage to use 4pc Marechaussee Hunter. No matter what, though, Codex wins every time.

- title: "**4pc Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City**"
  description: This option is for off-field, non-dps focused Mavuika builds. This,
    coupled with her Burst, adds tons of firepower to her team while still dealing
    non-negligible damage.

- title: "**2pc Mixes**"
  description: You’ll want Pyro DMG% most if you intend to resort to 2pc mix-and-match
    sets, followed by EM, followed by ATK%. Pyro + EM is still nearly 17% below the
    best option, so it is not recommended to utilize 2pc sets unless the substats
    are exceptional.
