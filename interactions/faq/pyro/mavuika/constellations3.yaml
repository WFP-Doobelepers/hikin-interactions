    A humble damage boost. It doesn’t really do anything but add more damage.

  description: "> _The All-Fire Armaments from the Elemental Skill The Named Moment
    receive all-round improvements:_\n> _· Ring of Searing Radiance: When the Ring's
    attacks hit opponents, a Flamestrider will crash into the struck opponent, dealing
    200% of ATK as Nightsoul-aligned AoE Pyro DMG._\n> _· Flamestrider: When Mavuika
    is riding the Flamestrider, she will also summon a Scorching Ring of Searing Radiance
    to follow her, which will decrease nearby opponents' DEF by 20% and deal 500%
    of ATK as Nightsoul-aligned AoE Pyro DMG to nearby opponents once every 3s. Mavuika's
    terrain-crossing abilities will also be further improved._\n> \n> _Additionally,
    when Mavuika is riding her Flamestrider and is not in combat, when her Nightsoul
    points drop to 5, she will gain 80 Nightsoul points. This effect can trigger once
    every 15s._\n\nThis constellation simply makes Mavuika better at everything she
    does while on-field.  She deals more damage. She shreds DEF (a very rare debuff)
    and deals additional instances of Pyro damage. Even in overworld exploration,
    her motorcycle mode lasts  twice as long."
