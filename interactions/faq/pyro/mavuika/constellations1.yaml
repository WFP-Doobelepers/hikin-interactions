    **Constellation 1 - The Night-Lord’s Explication**
  description: |-
    > _Mavuika's maximum Nightsoul points are increased to 120, and she gains Fighting Spirit 25% more efficiently. Additionally, she gains 40% ATK for 8s after gaining Fighting Spirit._

    A nice quality-of-life upgrade to Mavuika, and reasonable, but not essential, for a C1. It also extends the bike form by 50% for exploration.

    > _When in the Nightsoul's Blessing State, Mavuika's Base ATK is increased by 200, and she obtains the following effects based on All-Fire Armaments' form:_
    > _· Ring of Searing Radiance: Nearby opponents' DEF decreased by 20%._
    > _· Flamestrider: Mavuika's Normal Attacks, Charged Attacks, and her Sunfell Slice from the Elemental Burst Hour of Burning Skies deal 60%, 90%, and 120% of her ATK as increased DMG respectively._

    Most of the time, you are spinning donuts with her Charged Attack while she is on-field, and 90% increased damage is massive. It’s basically just raw damage, no matter which form it takes, and not revolutionary like the C2 of other Archons. The DEF-shred is certainly welcome, but Mavuika may be strongest as an on-field DPS anyways. Nevertheless, it is one of the best Constellations to aim for if you intend to bring Mavuika up in constellations, and a fine stopping point as well.
