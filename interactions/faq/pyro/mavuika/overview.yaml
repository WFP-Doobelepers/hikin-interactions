      *Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are theoretical suggestions.
      Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs, additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC, the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.*

- title: __OVERVIEW__
  description: "Mavuika is damage. Whether on-field or off-field, Mavuika is a high-end
    DPS with her best teams outdamaging most others compared on similar standards..
    Even as a support, while wielding the 4pc Cinder City set, she offers a series
    of massive buffs alongside her Burst. The Pyro Archon requires no Energy Recharge.
    This is because her Burst is fueled by Fighting Spirit instead of energy, which
    is built up through the consumption of Nightsoul Points across the party. Since
    energy is not a factor for Mavuika, she can build entirely offensive-focused stats.\n\nWhile
    Mavuika appears exceptional as an on-field DPS, her off-field capabilities should
    not be ignored. She is superior (some may argue ‘comparable’) to Xiangling in
    terms of damage, though she doesn’t have the relentless Pyro application that
    Xiangling does. However, Xiangling needs to build a truly difficult amount of
    Energy Recharge, which many players sometimes struggle with in order for Xiangling
    to function. Off-field, Mavuika is Xiangling on easy mode (as if Xiangling needed
    an easy mode).\n\nWhere Mavuika struggles is team restrictions and weapon affordability.
    The best options for these teammates are limited 5-star characters like Xilonen
    and Citlali. Her weapons are also not budget friendly, and her best 4-star option,
    Serpent Spine, requires a shielder to maintain its stacks. Citlali is the only
    worthwhile Natlan character at time of writing that offers this while also improving
    Mavuika’s damage, though the shield isn’t very durable. If you don’t have loose
    5-star CRIT Claymores laying around, you’re basically choosing between her signature
    weapon, Serpent Spine (Battle Pass), Talking Stick (Battle Pass), or an R5 Tidal
    Shadow (Craftable). \n\nAs with all other archons, Mavuika is designed to be a
    highly flexible unit with applications as wide as there are reactions… as long
    as you have another Natlan teammate. Thanks to her high motion values, she can
    ignore the mechanic and at least function on any team. However, since her forte
    is ‘damage,’ it’s hard to give a clearer overview than “big numbers good, but
    needing pricy characters and weapons less good.” You will, however, be rewarded
    handsomely for your investment."
