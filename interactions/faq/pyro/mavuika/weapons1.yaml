    **A Thousand Blazing Suns**
  description: Basically gives Mavuika +20% CRIT DMG and +28% ATK bonus for as long
    as Mavuika is active on the field. In Nightsoul stance, both of these are raised
    by 75%, making it a 35% CRIT DMG Bonus and 49% ATK bonus. This beats the next
    *unconditional* weapon by 20% and pre-stacked R5 Serpent Spine by roughly 17%.

- title: "**Serpent Spine R5 (Pre-Stacked)**"
  description: The overall best 4-star Claymore for most wielders of the weapon. Citlali
    provides a shield, so it won’t be too difficult to prevent the stacks from being
    lost, but shielding options might be limited outside of her without taking some
    major hit to team dps.

- title: "**Redhorn Stonethresher // Verdict // Beacon of the Reed Sea (without taking
    damage)**"
  description: These are mostly just good CRIT stat sticks with situationally useful
    passives. They’re all within a percent or so of each other, so it’s appropriate
    to put them all in one place here.
