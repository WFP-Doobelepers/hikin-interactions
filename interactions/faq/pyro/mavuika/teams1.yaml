  description: Mavuika is pretty demanding in terms of teammates. Bennett is a highly
    contested support, and will be used on most team compositions who truly wish to
    maximize team DPS. Xilonen is a recent limited 5-star *and* a highly contested
    support already, and then Furina or Citlali are the next best choices. Essentially,
    you’re expected to have pulled all the good 5-star Natlan supports or otherwise
    meta units, but the reward is probably the highest team DPS at the same standards.

    ### Mavuika | Bennett | Xilonen | Citlali

    Citlali is both a Natlan character plus a Pyro buffer, ontop of generating enough Cryo to forward-Melt with Mavuika, though the timing is somewhat strict for this. Mavuika in general wants as many Natlan characters as possible in order to maximize her Fighting Spirit and reliably Burst. Xilonen provides multi-elemental RES-shred and additional healing, as well as particles if wielding Favonius Sword. Bennett is Bennett. Cryo substitutes for Citlali fall off very hard due to not contributing Fighting Spirit and fewer buffs brought to Mavuika.

    Alternatively, Mavuika can be the off-field DPS and instead, your Cryo unit can be a Cryo on-field DPS like Ganyu or Wriothesley. Mavuika’s Burst can still Forward Melt the initial hit in these comps.

    ### Mavuika | Bennett | Xilonen | Furina
    Utilizing three limited 5-star Natlanians is hard on the wallet, so some might opt for Furina instead for comparable damage numbers. Furina provides Hydro application, a universal team buff based on healing (Bennett + Xilonen are plenty healing), and good off-field damage. Xilonen of course shreds, heals, and buffs, and Bennett heals and buffs ATK. Most Hydro substitutes won’t work as well since Mavuika does best with using Charged Attacks, not Normal Attacks, which makes Yelan and Xingqiu less viable.
