- title: __ENERGY RECHARGE REQUIREMENTS__
  description: "To sum this section up, Mavuika has zero Energy Recharge requirements.
    While this statement usually comes with caveats for other characters, such as
    using an Elemental Burst every other rotation, it surprisingly holds true for
    Mavuika, who simply does not need energy to use her Elemental Burst and is currently
    the only character in the game with this mechanic. She instead uses Fighting Spirit
    stacks to activate her burst, a mechanic unaffected by the Energy Recharge stat,
    which also enables her to use her Burst at half of its maximum capacity of 200
    stacks, albeit resulting in less damage dealt. \n\nShe gains fighting spirit when
    any character in the team consumes Nightsoul Points while in combat, including
    herself, as well as a tiny amount when any character lands Normal Attacks.\n\nThat
    being said, her Elemental Skill still produces 5 Pyro particles on activation,
    so your teams will not suffer from lack of energy when she is part of them.\n\nYour
    team’s ER requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more accurate
    estimate, please use the Energy Recharge Calculator linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vkmgp5n0bI9pvhUg110Aza3Emb2puLWdeoCgrxDlu4/copy).\nFor
