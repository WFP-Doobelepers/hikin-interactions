- title: __WFP SUBJECTIVE ANALYSIS__
  description: Mavuika being the Pyro Archon certainly sets high expectations, considering
    the land of Pyro is also called the Nation of war, and she certainly delivers.
    Taking the crown of the most powerful DPS in the game by a significant margin
    while also having use as an off-field character or buffer, she is an extremely
    versatile unit. These roles can be achieved by using either the Obsidian Codex
    or Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City artifact sets for each role respectively.

  fields:
  - name: Is my Arlecchino useless now?
    value: While it is true that Mavuika is stronger than her, it is not to the point
      where you should try to pull her just because of that fact. Arlecchino remains
      a competent DPS, albeit a slightly worse option than Mavuika. Mavuika also prefers
      and sometimes needs Natlan characters like Citlali or Xilonen to function, which
      might require further investment that should be considered when pulling.
    inline: false
  - name: Should I pull for Mavuika?
    value: |-
      If you like her, yes.
      If your dream is speeding around Teyvat on a motorcycle, yes.
      If you don’t like her but feel like you need a Pyro damage dealer like her, yes.
      If you don't have and are never planning on pulling on any Natlan unit other than her then she might not be a great option to pull.
    inline: false
  - name: Should I get C1 or R1?
    value: It depends on your goals. If your goal is higher damage, her C1 offers
      minimal levels compared to her R1  while other weapon options are significantly
      behind it in damage, especially F2P options. Her weapon is also very good on
      other Claymore users if you don’t mind sharing weapons between characters. If
      on the other hand your goal is to have her motorcycle last for 50% longer, then
      C1 will serve you well. It is worth noting that this increase will not affect
      her flying, climbing or water driving modes maximum continuous use time limit.
    inline: false
  - name: Should I try to get C2?
    value: C2 is a frankly ludicrous buff to her damage, so if you can afford it and
      aren’t thinking of pulling any of the other characters releasing soon, it might
      be a great pull.
