- title: "**Serpent Spine R1 (Pre-Stacked) // Talking Stick R5 **"
  description: The Battle Pass weapon, even at R1, surpasses all other 4-star weapons
    and all unnamed R1 5-star weapons. For those who want something less conditional,
    R5 Talking Stick is great when your character has Pyro applied to them, like in
    Bennett’s Burst circle. The damage output between these two weapons is roughly
    the same.

- title: "**The Other R1 5-Stars (Besides Skyward Pride) // Mailed Flower R5 // Talking
    Stick R1**"
  description: Skyward Pride is useless on Mavuika since she doesn’t need Energy Recharge
    at all. Other 5-star weapons are between 4-7% better than R5 Tidal Shadow, but
    1-4% worse than R5 Talking Stick.

- title: "**Tidal Shadow R5**"
  description: The craftable baseline. You’ll be married to the Bennett circle in
    most cases with Mavuika, so she will usually be healing, and you’ll usually have
    secondary healing from characters like Xilonen or Chevreuse. If neither of them
    are on the team, Furina also tugs Mavuika’s HP below 70%, allowing her to get
    healed by Bennett again while on-field.
