    It’s just more damage. There’s not much to say here. It’s worse than C1 due to lack of quality-of-life, but comparable damage increase.

    It looks much stronger than it actually is. When factoring in the decay rate compensation plus the additional 10%, you’re probably gaining about 30-35% dmg bonus, which is underwhelming for a fourth constellation on an archon.
